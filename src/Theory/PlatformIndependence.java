/*
 * In Java, the degree of platform dependence varies across different
 * components:
 * 
 * ==============================
 * 1. Java Code (.java files):
 * ==============================
 * 
 * Platform Independent: The Java source code written in .java files is platform
 * independent. It can be written on any platform and compiled on any platform
 * that has a compatible Java compiler.
 * 
 * ==============================
 * 2. Compiler:
 * ==============================
 * 
 * Platform Dependent: The Java compiler (e.g., javac) itself is a program that
 * must be executed on a specific platform. There are different versions of the
 * Java compiler for different operating systems and hardware architectures.
 * 
 * ==============================
 * 3. Bytecode (.class files):
 * ==============================
 * 
 * Platform Independent: The compiled bytecode contained in .class files is
 * platform independent. Once the Java source code is compiled into bytecode,
 * the same .class files can be executed on any platform that has a compatible
 * Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
 * 
 * ==============================
 * 4. Java Virtual Machine (JVM):
 * ==============================
 * 
 * 
 * Platform Dependent: The JVM is platform dependent because it must be
 * specifically implemented for each operating system and hardware architecture.
 * There are different versions of the JVM for Windows, Linux, macOS, etc.
 * However, the purpose of the JVM is to provide a platform-independent
 * execution environment for the bytecode, making the compiled Java applications
 * platform independent.
 * 
 * ==============================
 * Summary:
 * ==============================
 * 
 * Platform Independent: Java source code (.java files), Bytecode (.class files)
 * 
 * Platform Dependent: Compiler, JVM
 * 
 * This design ensures that Java code can be written once and run anywhere, as
 * long as there is a JVM available for the target platform.
